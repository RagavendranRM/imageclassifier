# Image Recognition Project

This project implements a web-based image recognition system using TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning and IBM Cloud for hosting the application.

## Overview

This project allows users to upload images and receive AI-generated captions. It leverages deep learning models to analyze the content of uploaded images and provide descriptive captions.

## Features

- Image upload functionality
- AI-generated image captions
- Responsive web interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
